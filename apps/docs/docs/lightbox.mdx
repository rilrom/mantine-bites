import { InstallScript } from '../components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import * as demos from '../demos/lightbox';

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="embla-carousel@^8.5.2 embla-carousel-react@^8.5.2 @mantine/carousel @mantine-bites/lightbox" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';
// ‼️ import carousel and lightbox styles after core package styles
import '@mantine/carousel/styles.css';
import '@mantine-bites/lightbox/styles.css';
```

## Do not forget to import styles

You've followed the installation instructions above but it is still not working?

- Lightbox isn't appearing.
- Carousel slides are rendered vertically
- No controls or indicators

You've fallen into the trap of not importing the lightbox and carousel styles! To fix the issue, import the lightbox and carousel styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@mantine/carousel/styles.css';
import '@mantine-bites/lightbox/styles.css';
```

## Usage

`Lightbox` is a full-screen modal-based image viewer built on `@mantine/carousel`. It uses a compound component pattern — slides are declared as `Lightbox.Slide` children. Each slide can have an optional `thumbnail` prop that renders in the thumbnail strip. Use the `initialSlide` prop to control which slide is displayed when the lightbox opens — click any image in the grid below to see it in action.

## Disable loop

By default, navigation wraps around when reaching the first or last slide. Set `loop={false}` to disable this behavior. The previous and next controls are automatically disabled at the boundaries.

<Demo data={demos.noLoop} />

## Minimal lightbox

Strip the lightbox down to its essentials by disabling controls, thumbnails, and the counter. Users can still navigate with arrow keys and swipe gestures.

## Placeholder thumbnails

When a `Lightbox.Slide` does not have a `thumbnail` prop, a placeholder icon is rendered in the thumbnail strip. This is useful for slides that contain non-image content.

<Demo data={demos.placeholderThumbnails} />

## Custom counter format

Use the `counterFormatter` prop to customize how the slide counter is displayed. The function receives the current zero-based index and total slide count.

<Demo data={demos.customCounter} />

## Keyboard navigation

The lightbox supports keyboard navigation out of the box:

- **Left arrow** — previous slide
- **Right arrow** — next slide
- **Escape** — close lightbox

## Accessibility

- Close button includes `aria-label="Close lightbox"`
- Navigation controls include `aria-label="Previous image"` and `aria-label="Next image"`
- Thumbnail buttons include `aria-label="Go to slide N"` and `aria-current="true"` on the active thumbnail
- Controls are disabled (not hidden) at navigation boundaries when `loop={false}`
